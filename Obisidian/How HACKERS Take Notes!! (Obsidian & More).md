	hey hackers blue Cosmo from CCS here welcome back to the channel today I want to show you guys how to effectively create notes both physically and digitally before we begin make sure to subscribe leave a thumbs up on the video and leave a comment saying hi I love hearing from you guys my physical note taking strategy consists of three notebooks a field notebook a notebook and a sketch pad my f notes are the dirty carry around shove it in your pocket notebook it's practically a phone to me at this point point the purpose of it serves mostly as a way to keep track of ideas I come up with on the Fly and general to-do list to have on my person here's a snapshot of my current field notes in the front I have general information written down so if I lose it I can have it be returned to me on the left Page I keep Theo list of tasks I want to complete and stuff I really need to buy well really need on the right or general notes of things I kind of need to remember or don't want to forget moving on to my notebook this baby is what brings my projects to life it serves as a bigger surface for me to plan projects draw flowcharts design UI a ton of other stuff I'll show you a few snapshots so you can get a better picture the last notebook I use is the scratch Pad it's great for temporary notes writing out math and different equations drafting ideas Etc that's pretty much the extent of my physical note taking Services I do recommend using graph paper especially if you have shitty handwriting like myself it's great for making diagrams flowcharts Etc also if you have the ability to put annotation stickers or sticky notes within your notebook they help a great deal so I definitely do recommend that moving on to the digital landscape when typing notes I use obsidian not sponsored anything but obsidian is an ultra powerful note ticking app that will organize notes written in a language called markdown if you don't know what markdown is it's a simple Market language used for documentation and no ticking let me show you how to use it this is my obsidian notebook it has has been pretty heavily rised so don't expect yours to look just like this when you first install obsidian um to the left I have my general file directory structure you guys can see the different folders I have and all of my notes now you'll notice my notes are actually not in a folder and I'll get into the reason why this is later in the bottom left I have the tag directory structure to show the different tags and how they are organized in the top right I have a mini calendar which is showing a more condensed version of this calendar right here this calendar isn't real I just kind of made this so that way you can see what my calendar would typically look like you can add different events for example I can say we have homework du on Monday we'll say it's a daily note make it a task event and save and you can see that now it's saying that we have homework due on this day we can also add different events so let's say on Tuesday we have a pool party and the pool party let's say it's a personal thing and let's say it goes from 4:30 all the way until 900 p.m. for some reason and boom you have your pool party and you can move it around wherever you want but I'll just keep it there for now um that's pretty much the extent of the calendar there's not too too much that goes into it but you can connect notes and stuff if you want to have uh notes oh actually connected to the actual note that you have on the calendar it's pretty powerful stuff but I'll leave that for you to explore in the bottom right I have the obsidian graph view you can just see how my notes are all kind of interconnected between each other it's really cool thing that aidian does you're trying to show that your notes should be your second brain if you will so this is kind of representing that um I also have a timer here a Pomodoro Timer padaro timer is just like a 25 minute work timer it's 5 minute break timer and you kind of just interval between the two and you can do work I kind of like to have it kind of keeps me on track and allows me to take healthy amounts of breaks from my work without getting too distracted from the stuff that I do need to get done I also have a math pad on the corner as well so I can do things like I don't know plot sign of X and boom I can have this plot and I can put this plot into any of my notes that I might need to have this is a plugin most of these are plugins but we will get into plugins and all those other things later in order to actually create notes in obsidian go ahead and hit crln to make a new note and we'll just call this notes I could probably make a better name but we we'll stick with notes for now in order to type notes you just type notes type notes right um I still couldn't have spelled that right somehow type notes there you go I also have Bim uh key bindings enabled on my obsidian notes just so you guys know don't feel the need to do that but just know that I do have that set up so if you're wondering how I'm flying through all this stuff that is the reason why now notes are cool but we also want to have General titles in our notes to kind of help us organize the different content between them so in order to do this you can use something called headers so I'll make a header one so you make one single hashtag with a space and header one so this is kind of like a title you can type uh text under here and the thing with um headers is that they decrement in size so header one is the largest size that uses one hashtag so you would use two hashtags to decrement the size to a header two and then you can use three hashtags to make a header three and you kind can kind of see how these are organized between each other which is pretty cool so past headers let's look at list so I will say these are lists they're different lists that we have in markdown / obsidian so let's go ahead and check those out the first list is a bulleted list so bulleted list and in order to create a bulleted list you just do a minus sign space and it creates the bullet so you can just type bulleted one bulleted oops two I can't type bulleted 3 cool and you guys can kind of see how that works the second type of list we'll cover is a numbered list and a number list is using a number and then the period space and then now you have your numbered list we can just do numbered one numbered two and numbered three the last type of list I'll show you guys how to make is a checkbox list so you can just do a checkbox and in order to create a checkbox you do a minus sign with an open opening and closing curly braid with a space in between them and that's how you make a checkbox we can just say checkbox one checkbox 2 and checkbox 3 cool and the cool thing with check boxes is again I mean they're they're check boxes so you can kind of check them off as you kind of complete stuff within your notes so it's pretty helpful to make to-do list and things like that next up is going to be how to make tables so in order to make a table you have a pipe it's the little vertical bar over your Enter key on the right and you have your pipe and then you can just put the title of the table you want to make so I'll just say title and then close pipe so these pipes kind of represent columns so like in between these two pipes would be a column on our table so we'll just say title value and have another columns now title is the First Column value is the second column now under there you can basically kind of open the pipe do a few minus signs and then close the pipe and it'll automatically format the table for you there is an obsidian plugin to help you with tables to make them a lot more fun and easy to work with but for now just ignore that we'll get to that later but know that you can make table so we'll just say item one cool and then item two cooler right and then boom that's how you make a table so it's pretty simple stuff that you guys can kind of work through if you want to have a table in general the ways to kind of take notes next thing I want to cover for you guys are code blocks so code blocks are ways for you to have code represented within obsidian so if you can have it one of two ways you can have it inline an inline code block looks like this and basically you would have a back tick it's the backwards apostrophe it's in the top left of your keyboard and here you can just put let's put some python code which is do print hello world so yeah just like that you have your you know in line code block alternatively you can have a multi-line code block by using three ptic it'll Auto format for you and we can type in our code here hello world you guys can see that you have the code block here allows you to copy it if you want to and put it into some other code editor or something like that if you want syntax highlighting at the end of the first row of btics feel free to just type in the language you're working in and obsidian for the most part will probably have the syntax highlighting language for you so that's pretty helpful when taking notes next up let's look at latex so latex is a way of typing math within obsidian so in order to do inline latex looks like this and then what you basically have is dollar signs so in between two dollar signs you can type in I'll just use chemistry right H 2 O and boom you have H 2 O which is pretty cool and also if you want multi-line you just do two dollar signs and enter and in between those two dollar signs you can have your latex so I just do H 2 O again and you guys can kind of see the difference between them right uh the multi-line kind of gets centered on your MSD notes which is pretty cool let's cover how to do images and embeds so in order to do images and embedding within your obsidian notebook let's go ahead to a terminal type Neo fetch I just need a screenshot of something so we'll get a screenshot of my Neo Fetch and you can just paste the image and it automatically gets embedded into here now you'll notice that the format for actually having images within obsidian is an exclamation point with two brackets and whatever the name of the images in between in obsidian if you go into your settings go into files and links in the default location for new attachments you can specify folder for you to save your attachments you guys can see I have saved mine in a folder called assets so every time I I paste a image into obsidian it gets saved into this assets folder that I have which is pretty helpful now note that you don't only have to embed images you can also embed other files this way right I can embed the notes file for example within our own notes file just you get an idea and you can embed it just like that now I'm not going to keep this embedded cuz it looks kind of weird but if you want to embed other files within your other files you can totally do that and the last thing I'll show you guys is how to do wik links and basically allow you to actually connect other files into your files but instead of like an ed it's more like a link like if you've been on Wikipedia and you can click on other links to visit other Pages it's just like that so visit other pages with and then in two brackets you can put the name of the file that you want to visit so if we make a new file let's call it new file and we can just put like hello in here then in our notes we can put the new file and boom so instead of this we say like check out our new file and you guys can see that new file is actually like linked and you can click it and it'll take you to the new file which is pretty cool um I'm going to go ahead and delete this you also see that now that I've deleted the new file note is kind of gray down here because that file no longer exists but I want to delete this cuz we don't really need that anymore anyway when it comes to organizing notes folders are by far the most popular method most of you are already familiar with folders as a method of storing files by similar subjects for example if you had a folder called python you can store all of your python notes in there but what if you had taken notes on how to build python classes for example what would you put this file in would you put it in a folder called python or your folder called programming resources tags are a different method of organizing notes a tag allows you to connect multiple topics to one exactly how a hashtag allows you to connect to multiple topics to like a social media post we can use tags within obsidian to organize our notes more ideally in obsidian let's go ahead and create some tags we can easily identify and search for this file within obsidian in obsidian there is a search tag at the top which allows you to search different ideas folders files properties of your notes within obsidian to create a tag you just use the hashtag and then the name name of your TX we'll just call this markdown course because this is a file that we created from our markdown course now I'm going to create a new note and in here blah blah blah let's just say this is notes from the markdown course we learned more advanced stuff about markdown all the coolest features and now we can also connect this to our markdown course so now if you click on it it will automatically be searched for and you can see the two notes from our markdown course this file specifically from the course is a really good resource for me to remember how to write certain pieces of markdown right let's say if I forget how to do a code block and markdown I already have it in my notes that I can refer back to but I don't want to search through the entire markdown course I just want to search for this specific file so this file I'll go ahead and give a resources tag so now I know that this file is not only part of a markdown course but also is a file that I want to refer to in the future for how to write basic markdown syntax so now instead of having tode between two folders I can just give it both tags and easily identify it tags actually have a subdirectory structure I don't remember the exact um professional title for this but basically you can add a file path to your tags to give them more specifical instead of resources I can do resources SL you can see some of the resources I already have here like resources for Linux resour resources for mobile resources for military resources for a bunch of stuff so in here I'll do resources SL markdown so now all resources that I want to have for markdown stuff I can check out and the thing is too like I can go on resources you guys can see the different resources I have here you guys can see marked down with my notes right there and this is amazing because you can now basically have one file linked to quote unquote multiple folders I quickly wanted to cover the pera not taking system per p a r a standing for projects area resources in archive is a system of organizing notes that guides users to know exactly how to store and access their notes projects are shortterm tasks that you're currently working on for example the script of this video would be considered a project an area is representative of an area of responsibility for me areas usually consist of notes from courses or long-term projects like the development of my website resources are notes that you want to be able to easily reference in the future like those get commands you can never remember or like in the video the markdown syntax that we wrote down last of all archives are notes that you no longer need but instead of throwing them out you kind of should keep them you should honestly keep most if not the majority or if not all of your notes uh that at least that you can keep uh you'll be surprised how often I've come back to Archive notes they can be really really helpful before I head out I wanted to show you some cool resources to spice up your obsidian workflow here are some of the notable plugins that I like to use Advanced slides a way to create slideshows with within obsidian Advanced tables helping you create better tables within your obsidian notes the calendar plugin allowing you to have a mini calendar within your obsidian notebook a Scala draw a way to draw within the obsidian notebook tends to be pretty helpful for handwritten notes the full calendar plugin allowing you to have a full scale calendar within your obsidian notebook paste URL into selection makes it a lot easier to have links within your obsidian notebook cuz you can just highlight a piece of text and paste the link on top of it so it's automatically formatted to the obsidian form structure of links if you are a Vim user like me you might appreciate the relative line numbers plug-in tag Wrangler can be a helpful way to organizing your tags if you want to rename tags across your entire notebook it can be helpful for moving tags that used to be in your archive to a resource or vice versa or however else you want to organize your tags the tag folder is a visual way of seeing your tags throughout your obsidian notebook it's the one that I have in the bottom left of the screen here templator is awesome it's a great way to create templates for different files that you will have within your obsidian notebook if you don't feel like having to retype your notes over and over again the cin board plug-in allowing you to create well cam in boards I do have this cam in board for the development of my website currently if you guys uh want to see progress on that just check out some of the streams that have been going on recently and again this is all in markdown in fact you can actually open this as markdown and you can see the markdown structure if you guys are curious about the theme that I have been using I using M mini flow it's a pretty awesome obsidan thing to use I also have the custom style settings on it so that way I can make it a little bit more pretty I also suggest checking out protocol blue this is an obsidian theme that I made on obsidian you guys can see blue Cosmo so if you guys want to support me and some of the stuff I worked on you guys can also use this obsidian theme I also want to give a special shout out to fellow YouTuber San foxal he has some incredible CSS files to pretty up the look of of your obsidian Vault so definitely suggest checking out his work other than that thank you so much for watching be sure to leave a like And subscribe to the channel happy hacking
