## Commenting

- Try to guide OP to a solution instead of providing one directly.
- Provide links to related resources.
- Answer the question and highlight side-issues if any exist.
- Don't "answer and run", be prepared to respond to follow up questions.
- Proofread your answers for clarity and correctness.
- Be polite.

## Posting

- [Format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like github or pastebin. Your code is hard to read and test otherwise.
- Be sure to try out suggestions you get and report back.
- [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) Keep your code Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable) and provide Example
- Include the error you get when running the code, if there is one.
- Ensure your example is correct. Either the example compiles cleanly, or causes the exact error message about which you want help.
- Avoid posting a lot of code in your posts.
- Posting homework assignments is not prohibited if you show that you tried to solve it yourself.
