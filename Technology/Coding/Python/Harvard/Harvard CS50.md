## Intro to python (Functions & Variables)

What you need
- Text Editor (vscode, Sublime text)
- [[Terminal]] ([[CLI]])

### Write your first prgram

First you are going to type the function print () 
Within the parenthesis following the print header it will print any given [[string]]  

For example
```
print("Hello World!!!")
```

The code above will print "Hello World!!!" to the terminal when ran. Now you may have noticed as you were typing within the editor that it will auto complete certain actions such as () or "". It is a common feature among devlopment environments that you wouldn't necessarily find else where like MSword or GDocs.  

### Functions

A function is like an action or a verb that lets you do something in the program.
And generally speaking, any language comes with some predetermined set
Of functions; some very basic actions or verbs that the computer will already
Know how to do for you, that the language, really, Will know how to do for you.
You as the "Human" or "Programmer" can use those commands at will to make the computer execute those things for you.

In the case of our example up above our function is print(). Now the print function doesn't just display some preordained string of text, that is to say that it will print whatever [[string]] we want to
