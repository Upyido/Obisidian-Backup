## Intro to python (Functions & Variables)

What you need
- Text Editor (vscode, Sublime text)
- [[Terminal]] ([[CLI]])

#### Write your first prgram

First you are going to type the function print () 
Within the parenthesis following the print header it will print any given [[string]]  

For example
```
print("Hello World!!!")
```

The code above will print "Hello World!!!" to the terminal when ran. Now you may have noticed as you were typing within the editor that it will auto complete certain actions such as () or "". It is a common feature among development environments that you wouldn't necessarily find else where like MSword or GDocs.  

#### Functions

A [[function]] is like an action or a verb that lets you do something in the program.
And generally speaking, any language comes with some predetermined set
Of functions; some very basic actions or verbs that the computer will already
Know how to do for you, that the language, really, Will know how to do for you.
You as the "Human" or "Programmer" can use those commands at will to make the computer execute those things for you.

In the case of our example up above our function is print(). Now the print function doesn't just display some preordained string of text, that is to say that it will print whatever [[string]] we want to 


#### Arguments

An [[argument]] is an input to a function that somehow influences its behavior.

The people who invented Python, of course, didn't necessarily know what it is you and I are going to want to print to the screen, so they designed this print function using these parentheses with the ability to take as input some string of text, be it in English or any other human language, that is what you want this function ultimately to print onto the screen. And what is it that the program is ultimately doing on the screen? 
Well, it's printing, of course. It's showing us hello, world on the screen. And that's generally in programming known as a side effect. 

##### Side effects
It can be visual, it can be audio. In this case, it's something that appears on the screen. and functions, therefore, can indeed have these side effects. One of the things they can do as this verb or action is to display on the screen as a side effect, something like those words that we wanted--
Hello, world.

#### Bugs 
Mistakes are okay, even seasoned programmers will make mistakes. These mistakes are most commonly referred to as [[Bugs]]. A term you may already be familiar with. But a bug can take many different forms. But at the end of the day bugs are just problems for you to solve. 
Remember that typos are a big deal to the computer as it will take you literally. You can not treat this as if you were texting. So if you don't finish your thought in the way the language expects, its not going necessarily run at all. 

For example 
```
print("hello world"
```
This code will not work and will turn back a syntax error as the parenthesis was never closed
