[[Print]] allows the computer to talk, or print a [[string]] of text as output. The string is what ever text you input in-between either (" " or ' ') quotation marks

You can print in one of three formats. 
- Print all strings individually 
- Print in one line using + in-between quotation marks
- Multiply your print function using * outside of quotes but within ()

You can use \n to denote a new line
