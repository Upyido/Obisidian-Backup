#  What is programming?
All programs use basic instructions as building blocks

Common ones in english
- Do this; then do that
- If this condition is true, perform this action; otherwise, do that action
- Do this action exactly 27 times
- Keep doing this until that condition is true

Instructions can be combined to implement more intricate decisions.

Example program
```
passwordFile = open('SecretPasswordFile.txt')
secretPassword = passwordFile.read()
print('enter your password.')
typedPassword = Input()
if typedPassword == secretPassword:
	print("Access Granted")
	if typedPassword == "12345":
	print("That password is one that an idiot puts on their luggage.")
	else;
	print("Access Denied")
 ```

# What is Python?
	Python is a programming language (with syntax rules for writing what is considered valid python code) and the python interpreter software that reads source code (written in the python language) and preforms its instructions

	The name python comes from the surreal british comedy group Monty Python
 
# Programmers Don't Need to Know Math
A common anxiety about learning to program is the notion that it requires a lot of math. However the truth couldn't be more contrary, not requiring more than basic arithmetic. In fact, being good at programming isn't that much different from being good at solving Sudoku puzzles.
