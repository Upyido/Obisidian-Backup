The technical description of a [[string]] is: an array of characters. The informal view of a string is a sentence. Strings are almost always written in code as a quoted sequence of characters, i.e., "this is a string".

Strings are like sentences. They are formed by a list of characters, which is really an "array of characters". Strings are very useful when communicating information from the program to the [[End User]] of the program. They are less useful when storing information for the computer to use.
