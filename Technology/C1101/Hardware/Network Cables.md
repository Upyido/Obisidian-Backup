# Network Cables (CompTIA A+ C 1101)

## Copper-Based Network Media
* **Twisted Pair Cabling:** Most common type, used in both enterprise and residential networks.
    * **Composition:** 8 copper conductors twisted into 4 pairs.
    * **Twisting:** Increases immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI).
    * **Shielding:**
        * **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):** Basic protection.
        * **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):**  Increased EMI protection with foil shielding. Some cables may have individual pair shielding for maximum protection.
    * **Connectors:**
        * **RJ-45 Jack:**  Registered Jack 45, also called 8 P 8 C connector (8 position, 8 contact). Used to terminate twisted pair cables.
        * **Termination:** The process of attaching a connector to the end of a cable.
* **Cable Jacketing:**
    * **PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride):** Non-plenum, used for drop cables. Emits toxic gas when burned.
    * **Plenum:**  Used in air handling spaces (HVAC). Does not emit toxic gas when burned. Stiff and difficult to work with.
* **TIA (Telecommunications Industry Association):** Defines electrical capabilities of cables through category standards (Cat cables).
* **Category Standards:**
    * **Cat 3:** Early Ethernet standard (obsolete).
    * **Cat 5:** Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps).
    * **Cat 5 e:** Enhanced Cat 5, supports Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) at short distances.
    * **Cat 6:** True Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) at full cable length (100 m).
    * **Cat 6 a:** Augmented Cat 6, supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 Gbps) at full cable length (100 m).
* **Cable Length:** Maximum transmission distance for twisted pair cables is 100 m (328 ft).
* **Wiring Schemes (TIA/EIA 568):**
    * **568 A and 568 B:** Define the arrangement of conductors within the RJ-45 jack.
    * **Straight-Through Cable:** Same wiring scheme on both ends (A-A or B-B). Used for connecting devices to network jacks.
    * **Crossover Cable:** Different wiring schemes on each end (A-B or B-A). Used for direct device-to-device connections (e.g., laptop to laptop, laptop to IP camera).
* **Coaxial Cable:**
    * **Composition:** Single copper conductor with non-conductive shielding and braided shielding.
    * **Types:**
        * **RG-59:** Thinner cable, used for shorter distances.
        * **RG-6:** Thicker cable, used for longer distances and higher frequencies.
    * **Connectors:**
        * **BNC Connector:**  Bayonet Neill-Concelman, twist-to-lock connector.
        * **F Connector:** Commonly used for cable television and modems.

## Fiber Optic Media
* **Advantages:**  Immune to EMI and RFI, higher bandwidth, longer distances.
* **Types:**
    * **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF):**  Longest transmission distance, uses a laser light source. Smaller core (9 microns).
    * **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF):**  Shorter transmission distance, uses an LED light source. Larger core (50 or 62.5 microns).
* **Connectors:**
    * **SC Connector:** Subscriber connector, older standard.
    * **LC Connector:** Lucent connector, newer standard, smaller size.
* **Duplex Cable:** Contains two fibers for transmitting and receiving data.
