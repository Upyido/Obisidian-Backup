# Troubleshooting PC Components (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Common Symptoms Across Components
* **Swollen or Leaking Capacitors:** On the motherboard, can cause instability and failure.
* **Socket/Slot Damage:**  Bent pins or damaged slots can prevent components from functioning.
* **Overheating:**  Excessive heat can damage components and lead to system instability.
* **POST (Power-On Self-Test) Beeps:**  Unusual beep codes indicate hardware problems.
* **Inaccurate Date/Time:**  May indicate a failing CMOS battery.
* **Grinding Noises:**  Can be a sign of failing fans or hard drives.
* **System Crashes and Reboots:**  Can be caused by various hardware or software issues.
* **Sluggish Performance:**  May indicate a failing component or insufficient resources.

## Troubleshooting Tools
* **Compressed Air:** Used to clean dust and debris from components and vents.
* **Multimeter:**  Measures voltage and can be used to test power supplies (use with caution).
* **Power Supply Tester:**  Safely tests the functionality of a power supply.
* **HWMonitor:**  Monitors system voltages, temperatures, and fan speeds.
* **Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool:**  Tests the functionality of Intel CPUs.
* **Windows Memory Diagnostic:**  Checks for memory errors.

## Motherboard Troubleshooting
* **Visual Inspection:**  Check for swollen or leaking capacitors, damaged slots, and burn marks.
* **CMOS Battery:**  Replace if the system clock is inaccurate.
* **POST Beeps:**  Listen for unusual beep codes.

## CPU Troubleshooting
* **Cooling System:**  Ensure the CPU fan and heatsink are functioning correctly.
* **Thermal Compound:**  Verify that the correct amount of thermal compound is applied.
* **Proper Installation:**  Make sure the CPU is correctly installed in the socket.

## RAM Troubleshooting
* **Memory Mismatch:**  Ensure all RAM modules have the same speed and capacity.
* **Seating:**  Make sure RAM modules are fully seated in the slots.
* **POST Errors:**  Check for POST errors related to memory.
* **Reseat and Reboot:**  Try reseating the RAM modules and rebooting the system.

## Power Supply Troubleshooting
* **Safety First:**  Do not open a power supply. Replace it if it fails.
* **Power Supply Tester:**  Use a power supply tester to diagnose issues.
* **Visual Inspection:**  Check for loose connections or physical damage.
* **Input Voltage:**  Verify the power supply is set to the correct input voltage.

## Key Takeaways
* **Symptom Recognition:**  Be able to identify common symptoms of hardware problems.
* **Troubleshooting Tools:**  Familiarize yourself with the tools used for diagnosing hardware issues.
* **Component-Specific Issues:**  Understand the common problems associated with each component (motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply).
* **Safety:**  Prioritize safety when troubleshooting hardware, especially power supplies.
