# Troubleshooting Networks (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Wireless Network Issues
* **Intermittent Connectivity:**
    * **Antenna Placement:**  Ensure proper antenna placement and orientation on the access point.
    * **Signal Strength:**  Check for weak signal strength using a Wi-Fi analyzer. Move closer to the access point or improve signal coverage.
    * **Network Adapter Properties:**  Verify network adapter settings (speed, duplex, roaming aggressiveness).
* **Slow Network Speeds:**
    * **Bandwidth Saturation:**  Too many devices connected to the network can cause congestion and slow speeds.
    * **Channel Interference:**  Overlapping channels on the 2.4 GHz band can cause interference. Use a Wi-Fi analyzer to identify and switch to less congested channels.
    * **Distance from Access Point:**  Greater distance can result in weaker signal and slower speeds.
    * **Outdated Standards:**  Older Wi-Fi standards (802.11 b/g) offer slower speeds. Upgrade to newer standards (802.11 n/ac/ax) if possible.

## Wired Network Issues
* **Cable Problems:**  Inspect cables for physical damage, loose connections, or improper termination.
* **Speed and Duplex Mismatch:**  Ensure the network adapter and switch are configured for the same speed and duplex mode (auto-negotiate is generally recommended).
* **Port Flapping:**  Indicates a port is repeatedly going up and down, possibly due to a hardware or configuration issue. Can be difficult to trace the source of the flapping.

## General Network Issues
* **Latency:**  High latency can cause delays in network communication. Use `tracert
