# Mobile Device Network Connections (CompTIA A+ C 1101)

## Cellular Network Technologies
* **2 G:**
    * **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications):**  Uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).
    * **GPRS (General Packet Radio Service):**  Upgrade to GSM, no significant speed increase.
    * **EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution):**  Faster data speeds than GPRS.
    * **CDMA 1 (Code Division Multiple Access):**  Uses codes instead of time slots.
    * **PRL (Preferred Roaming List):**  Used in CDMA networks for roaming.
* **3 G:**
    * **UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System):**  Used in Europe.
    * **CDMA:** Continued use in North America.
    * **Minimum Speed:** 144 kbps.
* **4 G:**
    * **WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access):**  Less popular standard.
    * **LTE (Long Term Evolution):**  Most popular 4 G standard.
    * **LTE Advanced:**  Improved version of LTE.
    * **Theoretical Speed:** 100 Mbps.
* **5 G:**
    * **Millimeter Wave:**  Uses a higher frequency spectrum for faster speeds.
    * **MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output):**  Antenna technology for increased capacity.
    * **Speed Range:** 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps (up to 4 Gbps with millimeter wave and MIMO).

## Connection Sharing
* **Hotspot:**  Shares a cellular data connection wirelessly with other devices.
* **Tethering:**
    * **Bluetooth Tethering:**  Shares connection via Bluetooth.
    * **USB Tethering:**  Shares connection via a USB cable.
* **Data Caps:**  Be mindful of data usage limits when sharing a connection.

## Wi-Fi
* **Connecting to Wi-Fi:**  Select the network name (SSID) and enter the password.
* **Saving Data:**  Using Wi-Fi helps conserve cellular data.

## Bluetooth
* **Short-Range Communication:**  Used for connecting peripherals (headsets, speakers, etc.).
* **Pairing:**  Devices need to be paired to establish a connection.
* **Bluetooth Versions:**  Different versions offer varying speeds and features (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy).

## Location Services
* **GPS (Global Positioning System):**  Uses satellites to determine location.
* **Cellular Location:**  Uses cell tower triangulation to estimate location.
* **Location Tracking:**  Can be used for mapping, navigation, and tracking.
* **Privacy:**  Consider disabling location services when not needed.

## Key Takeaways
* **Cellular Generations:**  Understand the evolution of cellular technologies (2 G, 3 G, 4 G, 5 G).
* **Connection Sharing:**  Know how to use hotspots and tethering.
* **Bluetooth:**  Recognize its purpose and pairing process.
* **Location Services:**  Understand how GPS and cellular location work.
* **Data Usage:**  Be aware of data caps and use Wi-Fi when possible.
