# Laptop Components (CompTIA A+ C 1101)

## Key Considerations for Laptops
* **Space:** Limited space impacts component size and design.
* **Cooling:** Efficient heat dissipation is crucial due to compact space.
* **Battery Life:**  Power consumption is a major factor in component selection.

## Major Laptop Components
* **Battery:**
    * **Types:**
        * **NiCad (Nickel Cadmium):** Obsolete, suffered from memory effect.
        * **NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride):** Less memory effect, higher capacity than NiCad.
        * **Lithium-ion:** Current standard, minimal memory effect, high capacity, but can be flammable.
    * **Important Notes:**
        * Match battery to laptop model.
        * Handle with care, avoid heat and damage.
* **Keyboard:**
    * **Non-Traditional Key Placement:** Compact layout with function keys and a ribbon cable connecting to the motherboard.
    * **Replacement Challenges:**  Often integrated into the case, requiring careful removal and reinstallation.
    * **Function Keys:** Can toggle hardware components (e.g., wireless adapter).
* **Motherboard:**
    * **Proprietary Design:** Specific to each laptop model.
    * **Integrated Components:** CPU, RAM, and other components are often soldered to the motherboard, making individual replacement difficult.
    * **Cooling System:** Compact cooling solutions with fans and heat pipes to dissipate heat from the CPU.
    * **Maintenance:** Regular cleaning with compressed air is important to prevent overheating.
* **RAM (SODIMM):**
    * **SODIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module):** Smaller form factor for laptops.
    * **Types:** DDR 3, DDR 4, etc.
    * **Integrated Memory:**  Often soldered directly to the motherboard.
* **Storage:**
    * **HDD (Hard Disk Drive):** Traditional spinning disk, slower and less durable than SSDs. Typically 5400 RPM in laptops.
    * **SSD (Solid State Drive):** Faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs.
    * **Form Factors:** 2.5 inch and smaller M.2 form factor.
* **Wireless Card:**
    * **Compact Size:**  Miniature versions of desktop wireless cards.
    * **Antenna Connection:**  Antenna wires are routed around the display, requiring caution during replacement.
* **Webcam and Microphone:**
    * **Integrated into Display:**  Typically located at the top of the screen.
* **Power Adapter:**
    * **Vendor Specific:**  Match the power adapter to the laptop model and wattage requirements.
* **Backlight Inverter:**
    * **Powers the Display:** Provides the necessary voltage to illuminate the LCD screen.
    * **Failure Symptoms:** Dim or faint display.
* **Security Features:**
    * **Physical Security:** Kensington lock slot for securing the laptop to a desk.
    * **Logical Security:** Biometric fingerprint readers for user authentication.
