# Storage Technologies (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
* **Technology:** Magnetic storage. Data is written and read magnetically on spinning platters.
* **Components:**
    * **Platters:** Circular disks that store data.
    * **Read/Write Heads:**  Read and write data to the platters.
    * **Actuator Arm:** Moves the read/write heads across the platters.
* **Speed:** Measured in RPM (Revolutions Per Minute). Common speeds include:
    * **5400 RPM:** Typical for laptops.
    * **7200 RPM:** Common for desktops.
    * **10,000+ RPM:**  Used in servers and high-performance systems.
* **Interfaces:**
    * **IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) / PATA (Parallel ATA):** Legacy interface, uses ribbon cables.
    * **SATA (Serial ATA):** Current standard, uses smaller, more efficient cables.
        * **SATA Revisions:**  SATA 1 (150 MB/s), SATA 2 (300 MB/s), SATA 3 (600 MB/s).
    * **SCSI (Small Computer System Interface):**  Used in enterprise environments, typically with high-speed SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) connections.
* **Hot-Swapping:** Ability to replace drives while the system is powered on (with appropriate RAID configurations).

## SSD (Solid State Drive)
* **Technology:**  Uses NAND flash memory to store data electronically.
* **Advantages:**
    * Faster than HDDs (no moving parts).
    * Lower power consumption.
    * More durable (shock resistant).
* **Form Factors:**
    * **2.5 inch:**  Common form factor.
    * **M.2:**  Compact form factor, commonly used in laptops and small form factor PCs.
* **Interfaces:**
    * **mSATA (mini-SATA):** Uses the SATA interface, limited to SATA speeds.
    * **NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express):**  Uses the PCIe bus for much higher speeds.

## Flash Drives and Memory Cards
* **Flash Drives:**  Small, portable storage devices that connect via USB.
* **Memory Cards:**  Used in various devices (cameras, smartphones, etc.). Common types include SD cards and microSD cards.

## RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
* **Purpose:** Combines multiple drives for increased performance or redundancy (fault tolerance).
* **RAID Levels:**
    * **RAID 0 (Striping):**  Improves performance by splitting data across multiple drives, but no redundancy.
    * **RAID 1 (Mirroring):**  Creates an exact copy of data on two drives for redundancy.
    * **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):**  Distributes data and parity information across three or more drives, providing both performance and redundancy.
    * **RAID 10 (Stripe of Mirrors):**  Combines RAID 0 and RAID 1, offering high performance and fault tolerance.

## Key Takeaways
* **Storage Types:**  Understand the differences between HDDs and SSDs.
* **Interfaces:**  Recognize the common interfaces used for storage devices.
* **Form Factors:**  Be familiar with the different form factors for SSDs.
* **RAID Levels:**  Understand the basic RAID levels and their purposes.
* **Troubleshooting:**  Be aware of common storage-related issues and how to troubleshoot them.
