# Storage Device Cables (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) / PATA (Parallel ATA)
* **Legacy Technology:** Largely obsolete.
* **Connectors:**
    * 40-pin connector.
    * 40-conductor ribbon cable (data).
    * 80-conductor ribbon cable (data with reduced interference).
* **Limitations:**
    * Maximum cable length of 18 inches.
    * Two devices per cable.
    * Susceptible to electromagnetic interference.

## SATA (Serial ATA)
* **Current Standard:** Widely used for internal storage devices.
* **Connectors:**
    * 7-pin connector (data).
    * 15-pin connector (power).
* **Features:**
    * One device per cable.
    * Up to 10 SATA ports on a motherboard.
    * Reduced interference compared to IDE.

## ESATA (External SATA)
* **Purpose:** Connects external SATA drives.
* **Features:**
    * No conversion overhead, maintains SATA speeds.
    * Less common due to the rise of high-speed USB and Thunderbolt.

## FireWire (IEEE 1394)
* **Legacy Technology:**  Developed by Apple, less common today.
* **Connectors:**
    * 4-pin (unpowered).
    * 6-pin (powered).
    * 9-pin (for higher speeds).
* **Features:**
    * Supports daisy-chaining of devices.
    * Provides 12 volts of power.
    * Used for external storage and other peripherals.

## SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)
* **Legacy Technology:**  Expensive, primarily used in enterprise environments.
* **Connectors:**
    * 50-pin, 68-pin, 80-pin (for parallel SCSI).
    * SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) connectors for serial communication.
* **Features:**
    * High speed and performance.
    * Often used with fiber optic connections for SANs.

## Key Takeaways
* **Storage Interfaces:**  Understand the different types of storage interfaces and their cables.
* **Legacy vs. Current:**  Recognize obsolete technologies (IDE, FireWire, SCSI) and current standards (SATA).
* **Connectors:**  Identify the various connectors associated with each interface.
* **External Storage:**  Be aware of eSATA and its purpose.
* **Troubleshooting:**  Understand how to troubleshoot basic storage connectivity issues.
