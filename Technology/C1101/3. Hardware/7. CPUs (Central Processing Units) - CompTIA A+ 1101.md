# CPUs (Central Processing Units) - CompTIA A+ 1101

## CPU Architecture
* **32-bit (x 86):** Older architecture, limited to 4 GB of RAM.
* **64-bit (x 64):**  Modern architecture, supports much larger amounts of RAM.
* **ARM (Advanced RISC Machine):**
    * Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC).
    * Low power consumption, commonly used in mobile devices.
    * Available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

## Multi-Core Processors
* **Cores:**  Individual processing units within a CPU.
* **Multi-Core:**  CPUs with multiple cores can process more information simultaneously, improving performance.
* **Multi-Processor:** Systems with multiple physical CPUs, typically found in servers and high-end workstations.

## Multi-Threading
* **Purpose:** Allows a single core to handle multiple threads (streams of instructions) simultaneously.
* **Intel Hyper-Threading:**  Intel's implementation of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT).
* **AMD SMT:**  AMD's version of simultaneous multi-threading.
* **Logical Processors:** Software sees double the number of physical cores due to hyper-threading.

## CPU Sockets
* **Purpose:** Connects the CPU to the motherboard.
* **Types:**
    * **PGA (Pin Grid Array):**  CPU has pins that insert into the socket.
        * **ZIF (Zero Insertion Force):**  Socket type that uses a lever to secure the CPU, preventing damage.
    * **LGA (Land Grid Array):**  Socket has pins, CPU has contact pads.
    * **BGA (Ball Grid Array):**  CPU is soldered directly to the motherboard, common in mobile devices.

## CPU and Socket Compatibility
* **Intel:**  Intel CPUs are compatible with Intel sockets.
* **AMD:**  AMD CPUs are compatible with AMD sockets.
* **No Cross-Compatibility:** Intel and AMD CPUs and sockets are not interchangeable.

## CPU Families and Sockets
* **Intel:**
    * **Core i 3, i 5, i 7, i 9:**  Consumer-grade CPUs.
    * **Xeon:**  Server-grade CPUs, support multi-processor configurations.
* **AMD:**
    * **Ryzen:**  Consumer-grade CPUs.
    * **Epyc, Opteron:**  Server-grade CPUs, support multi-processor configurations.

## Key Takeaways
* **CPU Architecture:** Understand the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
* **Multi-Core and Multi-Threading:**  Recognize how these technologies improve CPU performance.
* **CPU Sockets:**  Identify the different types of CPU sockets.
* **Compatibility:**  Be aware of CPU and socket compatibility issues.
* **CPU Families:**  Recognize the common Intel and AMD CPU families.
