# UEFI/BIOS (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Firmware
* **Definition:** Software embedded in hardware. Not quite software, not quite hardware.
* **Purpose:** Initializes hardware components and prepares the system for the operating system.
* **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System):**
    * Legacy firmware.
    * Limited to 4 partitions and 2 TB volume size.
    * Uses MBR (Master Boot Record) to boot the OS.
* **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface):**
    * Modern firmware.
    * Supports larger volume sizes (up to 9 zettabytes) and more partitions (up to 128).
    * Uses GPT (GUID Partition Table) for more reliable booting.
    * Offers faster boot times.
* **UEFI BIOS:**  Some manufacturers combine the terms due to the familiarity of "BIOS."

## Firmware Settings
* **Configuration:**
    * Network settings (PXE boot).
    * Power options.
    * Thunderbolt settings.
* **Date and Time:**
    * Maintained by CMOS battery.
    * Inaccurate date/time may indicate a failing CMOS battery.
* **Boot Options:**
    * Set boot order (hard drive, network, USB).
* **Security:**
    * **Passwords:** User/Supervisor passwords for access control.
    * **Secure Boot (UEFI):**  Works with TPM (Trusted Platform Module) to ensure only trusted operating systems and bootloaders can start the system.
    * **Chassis Intrusion Detection:**  Logs when the computer case has been opened.

## Key Takeaways
* **Firmware Function:**  Understand the role of firmware in the boot process.
* **BIOS vs. UEFI:**  Recognize the differences and advantages of UEFI over BIOS.
* **Firmware Settings:**  Be familiar with common settings found in BIOS/UEFI.
* **Secure Boot:**  Understand the purpose and function of Secure Boot.
* **Troubleshooting:**  Be aware of common firmware-related issues and how to troubleshoot them.
