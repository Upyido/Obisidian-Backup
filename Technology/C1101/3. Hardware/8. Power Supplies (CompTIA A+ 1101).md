# Power Supplies (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Power Supply Basics
* **Purpose:** Converts AC power to DC power and provides the necessary voltages to computer components.
* **Form Factor:** Must match the motherboard and case for compatibility.
* **Voltage Conversion:** Converts AC (Alternating Current) from the wall outlet to DC (Direct Current) used by computer components.
* **Voltage Regulation:**  Provides the specific voltages required by different components (3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V).

## Power Supply Features
* **Auto-Switching:** Automatically detects and adjusts to the input voltage (110 V/115 V or 220 V).
* **Fixed Input:**  Requires manually setting the input voltage using a switch.
* **Modular:**  Allows for connecting and disconnecting cables as needed, reducing clutter.
* **Efficiency:**  Measured by 80 PLUS ratings (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.). Higher ratings indicate greater energy efficiency.

## Power Supply Connectors
* **Main Power Connector:**
    * **20-pin:** Original ATX connector.
    * **20+4-pin:**  ATX connector with an additional 4-pin connector for the CPU.
    * **24-pin:**  Current standard ATX connector.
* **CPU Power Connectors:**
    * **4-pin (P 4):**  Used for older CPUs.
    * **8-pin (EPS/ATX 12 V):**  Used for modern CPUs.
* **Peripheral Connectors:**
    * **15-pin SATA:**  Powers SATA drives.
    * **6-pin PCIe:**  Powers older graphics cards.
    * **8-pin PCIe:**  Powers modern graphics cards.
    * **4-pin Molex:**  Legacy connector, sometimes used for fans and older devices.
    * **4-pin Berg:**  Legacy connector, used for floppy drives.

## Wattage and Sizing
* **Wattage:**  Measure of power output. Choose a power supply with sufficient wattage for all components.
* **Oversizing:**  It's generally better to have a power supply with more wattage than needed for future upgrades or expansion.
* **Calculating Wattage:**  Consider the power requirements of all components (CPU, GPU, drives, etc.) when choosing a power supply.

## Safety
* **Do Not Open:**  Power supplies contain high voltages and should only be serviced by qualified technicians.
* **Replace, Don't Repair:**  If a power supply fails, replace it with a new one.

## Key Takeaways
* **Power Supply Function:**  Understand the role of the power supply in a computer system.
* **Form Factors:**  Recognize the importance of matching form factors.
* **Connectors:**  Identify the different power supply connectors and their uses.
* **Wattage:**  Know how to choose a power supply with appropriate wattage.
* **Safety:**  Be aware of the safety hazards associated with power supplies.
