# Peripheral and Video Cables (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## USB (Universal Serial Bus)
* **Purpose:** Connects peripherals (keyboards, mice, printers, etc.) to computers.
* **Features:**
    * Serial communication.
    * Provides 5 volts of power.
    * Supports daisy-chaining of devices (up to 127).
* **Standards:**
    * **USB 1.1:** 12 Mbps (legacy).
    * **USB 2.0:** 480 Mbps.
    * **USB 3. X:** 5 Gbps to 40 Gbps (depending on the generation).
    * **USB Gen 1, Gen 2, etc.:**  Refer to different data transfer rates and lane configurations.
* **Connectors:**
    * **Type-A:** Most common, rectangular shape.
    * **Type-B:**  Typically used for printers and other peripherals.
    * **Mini-USB:** Smaller connector, less common in modern devices.
    * **Micro-USB:** Primarily used for charging mobile devices.
    * **USB-C:**  Reversible connector, increasingly common in newer devices.
* **Power Delivery (USB-PD):**  Allows for higher power delivery over USB-C, used for charging laptops and other devices.

## Thunderbolt
* **Purpose:** High-speed connection for data transfer and video output.
* **Connectors:** Uses the same form factor as Mini DisplayPort.
* **Standards:**
    * **Thunderbolt 1.0 and 2.0:**  Up to 20 Gbps.
    * **Thunderbolt 3.0:**  Up to 40 Gbps, supports dual 4 K displays.
* **Applications:**  External hard drives, displays, docking stations.

## Video Cables
* **VGA (Video Graphics Array):**
    * **Connector:** DB-15 (15-pin D-subminiature).
    * **Signal:** Analog.
    * **Resolution:**  Up to 640 x 480.
    * **Legacy:** Still found on some older devices.
* **DVI (Digital Visual Interface):**
    * **Connector:**  Variety of connectors with pins and a blade.
    * **Signal:**  Digital or analog.
    * **Types:**
        * **DVI-A:** Analog only.
        * **DVI-D:** Digital only.
        * **DVI-I:** Integrated, supports both analog and digital.
* **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):**
    * **Connector:** 19-pin connector.
    * **Signal:**  Digital video and audio.
    * **Features:**
        * Supports various resolutions (up to 8 K).
        * Some cables include Ethernet capabilities.
    * **Categories:** Different categories support different speeds and features.
* **DisplayPort:**
    * **Connector:** Full-size and Mini DisplayPort connectors.
    * **Signal:**  Digital video and audio.
    * **Advantages:**  Royalty-free, open standard.
    * **Standards:**  HBR (High Bit Rate) and UHBR (Ultra High Bit Rate) define different data transfer rates.

## Key Takeaways
