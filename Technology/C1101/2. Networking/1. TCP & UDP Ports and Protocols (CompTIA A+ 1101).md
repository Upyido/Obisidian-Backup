# TCP/UDP Ports and Protocols (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## What are Protocols and Ports?
* **Protocol:** A set of rules for communication between two endpoints.
* **Port:** A logical endpoint of a connection, used to identify a specific service.

## Port Ranges
* **Well-Known Ports (0-1023):** Common services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
* **Registered Ports (1024-49151):** Assigned to specific applications (e.g., RDP).
* **Dynamic Ports (49152-65535):**  Temporarily assigned for communication.

## TCP vs. UDP
* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
    * Connection-oriented, reliable delivery.
    * Error checking and retransmission.
    * Like certified mail with delivery confirmation.
* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
    * Connectionless, best-effort delivery.
    * No error checking or retransmission.
    * Like regular mail without tracking.

## Common Protocols and Ports
* **Email:**
    * **POP 3 (Post Office Protocol v 3):** Receives email (port 110). Downloads and deletes emails from the server.
    * **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Sends email (port 25).
    * **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Accesses email on the server (port 143).
* **Web:**
    * **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**  Unsecured web traffic (port 80).
    * **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**  Secured web traffic (port 443), uses TLS encryption.
* **File Transfer:**
    * **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**  Transfers files (ports 20 and 21). Uses TCP.
    * **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol):** Simplified file transfer (port 69). Uses UDP.
* **Remote Access:**
    * **Telnet:**  Unsecured remote access (port 23).
    * **SSH (Secure Shell):**  Secured remote access (port 22), uses encryption.
    * **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):**  Remote access to Windows desktops (port 3389).
* **Networking Services:**
    * **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):**  Accesses directory services (e.g., Active Directory) (port 389).
    * **DNS (Domain Name System):**  Resolves domain names to IP addresses (port 53).
    * **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**  Assigns IP addresses (ports 67 and 68).
    * **NetBIOS:**  Legacy name resolution for Windows (ports 137, 139).
    * **SMB (Server Message Block):**  Shares files and resources in Windows (port 445).
    * **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):**  Monitors network devices (ports 161 and 162).

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Memorize Ports:**  Know the port numbers associated with common protocols.
* **TCP vs. UDP:**  Understand the difference between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.
* **Security:**  Prioritize secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH) over unsecured ones (HTTP, Telnet).
* **Application:**  Know how these protocols are used in real-world scenarios.
