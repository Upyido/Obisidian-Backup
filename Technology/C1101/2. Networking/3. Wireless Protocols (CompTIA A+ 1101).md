# Wireless Protocols (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Wi-Fi (802.11)
* **IEEE 802.11:**  A family of standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs).
* **Frequencies:**
    * **2.4 GHz:**  Most common, more congestion, 11 overlapping channels.
        * **Non-Overlapping Channels:** 1, 6, and 11.
    * **5 GHz:**  Less congestion, 23 non-overlapping channels.
* **Standards:**
    * **802.11 a:** 5 GHz, 54 Mbps.
    * **802.11 b:** 2.4 GHz, 11 Mbps.
    * **802.11 g:** 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps.
    * **802.11 n (Wi-Fi 4):** 2.4 GHz/5 GHz, 600 Mbps.
    * **802.11 ac (Wi-Fi 5):** 5 GHz, 7 Gbps.
    * **802.11 ax (Wi-Fi 6):** 2.4 GHz/5 GHz, 10 Gbps.
* **Wi-Fi Alliance:**  Industry group that certifies Wi-Fi devices and promotes interoperability.

## Bluetooth
* **Purpose:**  Short-range wireless communication for peripherals (headsets, speakers, etc.).
* **Frequency:** 2.4 GHz.
* **Range:**  Approximately 10 meters (30 feet).
* **Pairing:**  Devices need to be paired to establish a connection.
* **Bluetooth 4.0:** Introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for reduced power consumption.

## Near Field Communication (NFC)
* **Purpose:**  Very short-range communication for contactless payments, data transfer, and access control.
* **Range:**  Up to 2 cm (almost touching).
* **Applications:**  Apple Pay, Android Pay, data transfer between devices, proximity cards.

## Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
* **Purpose:**  Uses radio waves to identify and track objects.
* **Components:**
    * **Tag:**  Stores information about the object.
    * **Reader:**  Reads data from the tag.
    * **Antenna:**  Enables wireless communication.
* **Types:**
    * **Passive Tags:**  No internal power source, shorter range.
    * **Active Tags:**  Have an internal power source, longer range (up to 100 meters).

## Long-Range Fixed Wireless
* **Purpose:**  Extends wireless communication beyond the range of Wi-Fi.
* **Range:**  Up to 1 kilometer (3280 feet).
* **Applications:**  Connecting buildings, providing internet access in remote areas.

## Key Takeaways:
* **Wireless Standards:**  Understand the different 802.11 standards and their capabilities.
* **Frequencies and Channels:**  Know the differences between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.
* **Bluetooth:**  Recognize its purpose and pairing process.
* **NFC and RFID:**  Understand their applications and range limitations.
* **Long-Range Wireless:**  Recognize its use for extending network connectivity.
