# Internet Connection Types (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Wired Connections
* **Fiber Optic:**
    * **Technology:** Uses light signals transmitted through glass or plastic fibers.
    * **Advantages:** High bandwidth, long transmission distances, less susceptible to interference.
    * **Disadvantages:**  Expensive, limited availability.
* **Cable Internet:**
    * **Technology:** Uses coaxial cables (typically RG 6).
    * **Standard:** DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) allows for data, TV, and phone signals over the same cable.
    * **Advantages:**  Widely available, offers high speeds.
    * **Disadvantages:**  Shared bandwidth, speeds can fluctuate depending on network congestion.
* **Dial-up:**
    * **Technology:** Uses existing phone lines (PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network).
    * **Advantages:** Widely available, low cost.
    * **Disadvantages:** Very slow speeds, ties up the phone line.
* **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):**
    * **Technology:**  Uses existing phone lines to transmit digital signals.
    * **Advantages:**  Allows simultaneous internet and phone use, faster than dial-up.
    * **Disadvantages:**  Speed and availability depend on distance from the telephone exchange.
    * **ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line):**  Most common type, offers different upload and download speeds.

## Wireless Connections
* **Cellular:**
    * **Technology:**  Uses cellular networks (4 G LTE, 5 G).
    * **Advantages:**  Wireless access, good speeds in areas with strong signal.
    * **Disadvantages:**  Signal strength and data caps can be limitations, affected by weather.
* **Satellite:**
    * **Technology:**  Uses satellites in orbit to transmit and receive data.
    * **Advantages:**  Available in remote areas, unbounded by terrestrial infrastructure.
    * **Disadvantages:**  High latency, affected by weather, requires a clear line of sight to the satellite.
* **WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider):**
    * **Technology:**  Uses various wireless technologies to provide internet access in areas where wired connections are limited.
    * **Advantages:**  Available in rural areas, can offer good speeds.
    * **Disadvantages:**  Signal strength can be affected by line-of-sight issues and interference.

## Key Takeaways
* **Connection Types:**  Understand the different types of internet connections and their characteristics.
* **Availability:**  Recognize that availability varies depending on location and infrastructure.
* **Speed and Bandwidth:**  Consider the speed and bandwidth requirements when choosing a connection type.
* **Cost:**  Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different options.
* **Wireless Challenges:**  Be aware of the factors that can affect wireless connections (weather, line of sight).
