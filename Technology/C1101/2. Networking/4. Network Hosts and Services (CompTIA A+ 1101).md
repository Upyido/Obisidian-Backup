# Network Hosts and Services (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Network Hosts
* **Definition:** A generic term for any device connected to a network that provides services.
* **Examples:** Servers, internet appliances, IoT devices, and more.

## Servers
* **Directory Services Server:**
    * Stores and manages network objects (users, computers, groups).
    * Example: Active Directory.
    * Often functions as an authentication server.
* **Mail Server:**
    * Handles electronic mail (email).
    * Types:
        * **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):**  Sends email.
        * **POP 3 (Post Office Protocol v 3):** Retrieves email.
        * **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Accesses email on the server.
* **DNS Server (Domain Name System):**
    * Translates domain names into IP addresses (name resolution).
* **DHCP Server (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**
    * Dynamically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices.
* **File Server:**
    * Stores and shares files over a network.
    * Protocols: FTP, NFS, SMB.
* **Print Server:**
    * Manages printers and print jobs.
    * Centralizes printer management in a network.
* **Syslog Server:**
    * Collects and stores system logs from network devices.
    * Commonly used in Linux/Unix environments.
* **Web Server:**
    * Hosts websites and delivers web pages to clients.
    * Uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

## Internet Appliances
* **Definition:** Specialized devices that provide network services, often security-related.
* **Examples:**
    * **UTM (Unified Threat Management):** Combines multiple security functions (firewall, antivirus, intrusion detection) into a single device.
    * **Load Balancer:** Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.
    * **Proxy Server:** Intermediary between clients and web servers, used for filtering content, caching, and security.

## Other Network Hosts
* **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition):**
    * Used for industrial control systems (power plants, water systems).
    * Collects data from sensors and controls industrial processes.
* **IoT (Internet of Things):**
    * Network of interconnected devices that collect and exchange data.
    * Examples: Smart home devices, wearable technology, industrial sensors.

## Key Takeaways:
* **Network Hosts:**  Understand the broad definition and various types of network hosts.
* **Server Roles:**  Recognize the functions of different servers in a network.
* **Internet Appliances:**  Understand the purpose of specialized network devices.
* **Emerging Technologies:**  Be aware of SCADA and IoT and their impact on networking.
