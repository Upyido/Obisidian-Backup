# IP Addressing (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## IPv 4 Addressing
* **Purpose:**  Provides a unique logical address for devices on a network.
* **Format:** 32-bit binary address, represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
* **Dotted Decimal Notation:**  Divides the 32-bit address into four 8-bit octets, separated by periods.
* **Binary Conversion:**
    * Each octet is converted to its binary equivalent using place values (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).
    * Subtract place values from the decimal number, marking a "1" for each value used and a "0" for those not used.
* **Subnet Mask:**
    * Used to identify the network portion and host portion of an IP address.
    * Divides the IP address into network ID and host ID.
    * Example: 255.255.255.0 (identifies the first three octets as the network portion).
* **IP Address Classes:**
    * **Class A:** 1.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
    * **Class B:** 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
    * **Class C:** 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
* **Private IP Addresses:**
    * **Class A:** 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    * **Class B:** 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    * **Class C:** 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    * Not routable on the public internet.
* **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing):**
    * **Range:** 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254
    * **Purpose:**  Self-assigned IP address when a DHCP server is unavailable.
    * **Limitation:**  Communication limited to devices on the same APIPA network.

## IPv 6 Addressing
* **Purpose:**  Successor to IPv 4, designed to address IP address exhaustion.
* **Format:** 128-bit hexadecimal address, divided into eight 16-bit blocks separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a 2 e:0370:7334).
* **Abbreviation:**
    * Leading zeros in a block can be omitted.
    * Consecutive blocks of zeros can be replaced with a double colon (::) only once in an address.
* **Address Types:**
    * **Global:**  Routable on the public internet.
    * **Unique Local:** Similar to private IPv 4 addresses.
    * **Link Local:**  Used for communication within a local network.

## Key Takeaways
* **IPv 4 Structure:**  Understand the format and components of an IPv 4 address.
* **Binary Conversion:**  Know how to convert between dotted decimal and binary representation.
* **Subnet Mask:**  Recognize its role in identifying network and host portions.
* **IP Address Classes:**  Be familiar with the class ranges and private IP addresses.
* **APIPA:**  Understand its purpose and limitations.
* **IPv 6:**  Recognize the format and address types of IPv 6.
