# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - CompTIA A+ 1101

## What is DHCP?
* **Purpose:**  Automates the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on a network.
* **Benefits:**
    * Reduces administrative burden.
    * Minimizes configuration errors.
    * Enables efficient IP address management.

## Static vs. Dynamic IP Assignment
* **Static Assignment:**
    * Manual configuration of IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server on each device.
    * Time-consuming and prone to errors.
* **Dynamic Assignment (DHCP):**
    * Devices automatically obtain IP addresses and other settings from a DHCP server.
    * Efficient and scalable.

## DHCP Lease Process (DORA)
1. **Discover:** Client broadcasts a message to find DHCP servers.
2. **Offer:** DHCP servers respond with an offer of an IP address and other settings.
3. **Request:** Client selects an offer and requests the configuration.
4. **Acknowledge:** DHCP server confirms the lease and assigns the IP address.

## DHCP Lease
* **Temporary Assignment:** IP addresses are leased to clients for a specific duration.
* **Renewal:** Clients can renew the lease before it expires.
* **Expiration:**  If the lease is not renewed, the IP address is returned to the pool for reassignment.

## DHCP Scope
* **Definition:** A range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can assign to clients.
* **Address Pool:** The available IP addresses within the scope.
* **Reservations:**  Allows administrators to reserve specific IP addresses for certain devices (e.g., printers).

## Key Takeaways
* **DHCP Benefits:** Understand how DHCP simplifies network administration.
* **Static vs. Dynamic:**  Know the difference between manual and automatic IP address assignment.
* **Lease Process:**  Memorize the DORA acronym and understand the steps involved.
* **Scope and Reservations:**  Know how to define the range of IP addresses and reserve addresses for specific devices.
