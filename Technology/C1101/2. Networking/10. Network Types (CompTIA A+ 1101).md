# Network Types (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Personal Area Network (PAN)
* **Smallest network type.**
* **Covers a very limited area.**
* **Examples:** Connecting a computer to a printer, keyboard, mouse, or smartphone.

## Local Area Network (LAN)
* **Connects devices within a single geographical location.**
* **Privately owned and managed.**
* **Uses private IP addresses.**
* **Examples:** Home network, office network, school network.

## Virtual LAN (VLAN)
* **Divides a physical switch into multiple logical networks.**
* **Isolates traffic between VLANs.**
* **Improves security and performance.**
* **Example:** Separating departments or devices (e.g., VoIP phones) on a network.

## Wide Area Network (WAN)
* **Connects LANs across multiple geographical locations.**
* **Uses public and private links.**
* **Often relies on ISPs for connectivity.**
* **Examples:** Connecting offices in different cities or countries, the Internet.

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
* **Connects devices across a city or metropolitan area.**
* **Larger than a LAN, smaller than a WAN.**
* **Often uses fiber optic cables for high-speed connections.**

## Storage Area Network (SAN)
* **Dedicated network for storage devices.**
* **Uses high-speed technologies (e.g., fiber optic) and specialized switches.**
* **Provides low-latency access to storage.**
* **Expensive, typically used in enterprise environments.**

## Network Attached Storage (NAS)
* **Dedicated storage device connected to a network.**
* **Acts as a file server.**
* **Lower cost alternative to a SAN.**
* **Suitable for small to medium-sized businesses.**

## Key Takeaways
* **Network Types:**  Understand the different types of networks and their characteristics.
* **Scale and Scope:**  Recognize the differences in geographical coverage and complexity.
* **VLANs:**  Understand how VLANs segment networks.
* **WAN vs. MAN:**  Distinguish between wide area networks and metropolitan area networks.
* **Storage Networks:**  Know the difference between SANs and NAS devices.
