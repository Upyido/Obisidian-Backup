# Networking Hardware (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Network Interface Card (NIC)
* **Purpose:** Connects a device to a network.
* **Types:**
    * **Dedicated Adapter:**  Expansion card that can be added to a computer.
    * **Embedded:** Integrated into the motherboard.

## Hubs
* **Purpose:** Connects multiple devices in a network.
* **Function:** Repeats signals received on one port to all other ports.
* **Limitations:**  Causes network congestion and performance degradation.
* **Legacy:** Largely replaced by switches.

## Switches
* **Purpose:** Connects multiple devices in a network.
* **Function:**  Forwards data only to the intended recipient based on MAC addresses.
* **Types:**
    * **Unmanaged:** Plug-and-play, no configuration options.
    * **Managed:**  Allows for configuration of ports, VLANs, and other features.

## Power over Ethernet (PoE)
* **Purpose:**  Delivers power to devices over Ethernet cables.
* **Applications:** IP cameras, VoIP phones, wireless access points.
* **Standards:**
    * **PoE:** 15.4 watts.
    * **PoE+:** 30 watts.
    * **PoE++ (Type 3):** 60 watts.
    * **PoE++ (Type 4):** 100 watts.
* **Components:**
    * **PoE Injector:** Adds PoE capability to a non-PoE switch.
    * **PoE Switch:**  Has built-in PoE capability.

## Wireless Access Point (WAP)
* **Purpose:** Connects wireless devices to a wired network.
* **Function:**  Acts as a bridge between Wi-Fi and Ethernet.

## Routers
* **Purpose:** Connects networks together (e.g., a local network to the internet).
* **Function:**  Forwards traffic between networks based on IP addresses.

## Firewalls
* **Purpose:**  Protects a network from unauthorized access.
* **Function:**  Filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules.
* **Placement:**  Sits at the edge of the network, between the router and the ISP.

## Modems
* **Purpose:**  Connects a network to the internet service provider (ISP).
* **Types:**
    * **Cable Modem:**  Uses coaxial cable.
    * **DSL Modem:**  Uses phone lines.
    * **Fiber Optic Modem (ONT):**  Uses fiber optic cable.
* **Multi-Function Devices:**  May include routing and switching capabilities.

## Patch Panels
* **Purpose:**  Organizes and connects network cables.
* **Function:**  Provides a central point for connecting devices.

## Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
* **Purpose:**  Manages network devices and traffic through software.
* **Function:**  Allows for centralized control and automation of network functions.

## Key Takeaways:
* **Identify Devices:**  Recognize different networking hardware components.
* **Understand Functions:**  Know the purpose of each device and how it contributes to the network.
* **PoE:**  Understand the different PoE standards and their power capabilities.
* **Network Edge:**  Recognize the boundary between a local network and external networks.
* **SDN:**  Understand the concept of software-defined networking.
