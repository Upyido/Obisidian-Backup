# DNS (Domain Name System) - CompTIA A+ 1101

## What is DNS?
* **Purpose:** Provides name resolution, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.
* **Human-Friendly:** Easier to remember names (e.g., www.google.com) than IP addresses (e.g., 172.217.160.142).

## FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
* **Components:**
    * **Host Name:**  Specific device name (e.g., DC-01).
    * **Domain Name:**  Network or organization name (e.g., example. Com).
    * **Top-Level Domain:**  Farthest right portion (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
* **Example:**  DC-01. Example. Com

## Name Resolution Process
1. **Check Host File:**  Local file on the computer with static mappings (rarely used).
2. **Check Resolver Cache:**  Local storage of previous DNS lookups.
3. **Query DNS Server:**  Computer contacts a configured DNS server (internal or ISP-provided).
4. **DNS Server Lookup:**
    * **Recursive Query:** DNS server queries other DNS servers to find the IP address.
    * **Iterative Query:**  DNS server provides referrals to other DNS servers.
5. **Return IP Address:**  DNS server provides the IP address to the computer.

## DNS Records
* **A Record (Address Record):** Maps a host name to an IPv 4 address.
* **AAAA Record (Quad A Record):** Maps a host name to an IPv 6 address.
* **PTR Record (Pointer Record):**  Reverse lookup, maps an IP address to a domain name.
* **MX Record (Mail Exchanger Record):**  Identifies the mail server for a domain.
* **TXT Record (Text Record):**  Stores text information, often used for:
    * **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**  Email authentication to prevent spoofing.
    * **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**  Email authentication to prevent spam.
    * **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):**  Email authentication and reporting.

## Key Takeaways:
* **Name Resolution:** Understand the process of translating domain names to IP addresses.
* **FQDN Structure:**  Recognize the components of a fully qualified domain name.
* **DNS Records:**  Know the common types of DNS records and their functions.
* **Security:**  Be aware of how TXT records are used for email security.
* **Troubleshooting:**  Understand the basic steps in troubleshooting DNS issues.
