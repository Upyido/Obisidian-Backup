# Configuring IP Addressing (CompTIA A+ 1101)

## Accessing Network Adapter Settings
* **Windows:**
    * Search for "Network Connections" or "ncpa. Cpl".
    * Right-click on the network adapter and select "Properties".

## Viewing Network Adapter Status
* **Windows:**
    * Right-click on the network adapter and select "Status".
    * Click "Details" to view IP configuration, MAC address, and DHCP status.

## Configuring IPv 4 Addressing
* **Windows:**
    * In the network adapter properties, select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv 4)" and click "Properties".
    * Choose between:
        * **Obtain an IP address automatically:**  Uses DHCP.
        * **Use the following IP address:**  Static IP configuration.
* **Static IP Configuration:**
    * **IP address:**  Unique address within the network.
    * **Subnet mask:**  Defines the network portion of the IP address.
    * **Default gateway:**  IP address of the router.
    * **DNS server:**  IP address of the DNS server for name resolution.

## Configuring IPv 6 Addressing
* **Windows:**
    * In the network adapter properties, select "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv 6)" and click "Properties".
    * Choose between:
        * **Obtain an IPv 6 address automatically:**  Uses DHCPv 6 or auto-configuration.
        * **Use the following IPv 6 address:**  Static IPv 6 configuration.

## Alternate Configuration (Windows)
* **Purpose:**  Provides a fallback IP configuration when DHCP is unavailable.
* **APIPA:**  Automatically assigns an IP address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range.

## Key Takeaways
* **Network Adapter Properties:**  Know how to access and navigate network adapter settings.
* **IPv 4 Configuration:**  Understand how to configure both static and dynamic IPv 4 addresses.
* **IPv 6 Configuration:**  Be familiar with IPv 6 configuration options.
* **Alternate Configuration:**  Recognize the purpose of the alternate configuration tab.
* **Troubleshooting:**  Use the `ipconfig` command and network adapter status to troubleshoot IP configuration issues.
