Gemini prompt
Can you make me a python script for linux, or suggest a better alternative to make audacity recordings from google text to speech. The scripts needs to first request the Customer site, second it needs to request what the event type is. third it needs to request the site location. fourth it needs to create a prompt for gemini ai based on the site name and event type and location. fifth it needs copy the prompt. sixth it needs to go to google gemini ai and send the prompt. note that the prompt should be structured in a way that only the return from gemini includes the text for the voicemail greeting. seventh it needs to copy the voicemail output. eighth its needs to open google text to speech. ninth make sure the google text to speech demo is set for "sulafat". tenth it needs to make sure the text to speech demo is set to interactive voice recording (IVR). eleventh it needs to paste the voicemail greeting into the google text to speech demo field. twelfth it needs to play the audio and verify with user that it is good before continuing. 13th its needs to make sure audacity is running. if it is not it needs to open it. then make sure it clears the recovery window if present. then clears any present audio in the file. if it is open it needs to clear any present audio. 14th it needs to record the google text to speech output. 15th it needs to stop recording when the google text to speech output finished. 16th it needs to export as .wav. 17th it needs to set the file name as the event type. 18th the program needs a reset button to allow the process to start over and a button next to it to close the program.
